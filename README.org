#+TITLE: JSON To HKTCPTSD Protocol Daemon
#+Author: Acharya U
#+PROPERTY:

* Introduction
If you want to use an extension to send requests to HKTCPTSD, you can't send raw data throuch TCP socket from the browser, so to solve that problem, you can just send a POST request with a JSON file to this program, And the JTHPD will translate it to HKTCPTSD protocol and send it to HKTCPTSD.

* JSON to send
an example of JSON to send is:
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  {
      pass: "rootadmin",
      id: 69,
      string: "foo",

  }
#+END_SRC
*pass* contains the password string, *id* contains the id and *string* contains the string to send
The JSON has to be sent through a HTTP POST request

* Environment Variables
The help page that is shown right after running the program tells all about the environment variables needed
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This is the Help Page
Environment variables:
JTHPD_ADRESS: for your listening adress default: 127.0.0.1:7979
JTHPD_MAX_PROCESS: number of threads: default 8
SEND_ADRESS: adress where hktcptsd is listeining to, default: 127.0.0.1:6969
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Why was this feature not added to HKTCPTSD
Because I did not want HKTCPTSD to be bloated, JTHPD imports crates from crates.io, which I did not want to do for HKTCPTSD
** Imported Crates
*** serde
this crate is for converting JSON to strict through a macro
*** httparse
this crate is for parsing HTTP requests

* Future TODO
- NOTHING, this is prefect
